## Executive Summary
This project involves the analysis of a piece of malware discovered on a classmate's computer. The malware was initially delivered through a Word document (`Project.doc`) sent via email. Upon opening, the document creates a scheduled task on the victim's computer, which triggers daily at 8:45 AM. The task downloads an executable payload (`q.exe`) from a remote server and executes it, capturing the first 200 keystrokes entered by the user along with the computer's name. This information is then sent back to the attacker's server, enabling the extraction of potentially sensitive information.

## Detailed Analysis

### Program Details
- **File Name:** `Project.doc`
- **Hash Values:**  
  - **MD5:** 92a943c0531baa35a6764a208c820420  
  - **SHA1:** 7f812d23068c7d6633eab6a72413bcecd7350370
- **Executable:** `q.exe`  
  - **MD5:** 357e7d833cf500432aa809fec4b4a7b6  
  - **SHA1:** a832b7c7f37b14965bc2180aa9338804483492fc

### Static Analysis
The Word document contained macros that were extracted and analyzed. The macros were found to be obfuscated, but after deobfuscation, it was determined that they execute a PowerShell script to download and run the `q.exe` executable. This script also establishes persistence by creating a new registry item.

### Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis confirmed the capabilities of the `q.exe` payload. The executable was found to act as a keylogger, recording keystrokes and sending them to a remote server. Network activity to the domain `xttp://telemetry.securityresearch.ca/t` was observed, which indicated communication with the attacker's server.

## Conclusions
This malware is a keylogger that establishes persistence on the victim's machine and sends captured keystrokes to a remote server. Immediate action is recommended to check all school computers for this malware and prevent further compromise.
